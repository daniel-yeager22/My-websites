            First paragraph HTML (HyperText Marlup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It provides the basic building blocks for webpages by defining elements like <br/>
            headings, paragarh, links, images and multimedia. HTML uses a system of tag and attribites to mark up content, enabling browsers to interpret and render it visually for users. For example, the p tag <br/>
            defines a paragraph, while the tad create hyperlinks, making HTML the backnone of web navigation and cotent presentation. HTML is a foundational technology of the web and works seamlessly with <br/>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. it is designed to be both human readiable and machine interpretable, allowing developers to build structured documents. With <br/>
            advancements like HTML5, the language has incorporated supports for rich media, such as video, audio and interactive elements, without requiring  addiotional plugins. This has made HTML more versatile and <br/>
            integral to modern web development. <br/>

        <h2 class="title">CASCADING STYLE SHEET (CSS)</h2>
        <h4>Is responsible of the style of the Website</h4>
        <p>
            Second paragraph. Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is a style sheet language used to describe the visual presentation of a document written in markup languages like HTML. CSS allows developers to separate <br/>
            content from design by specifying style such as colors, fonts, layout and spacing. This separation enables more efficient and consistent design management, as changes to style can be made in one place and <br/>
            applied accross multiple pages or element. CSS operates in a cascading manner, meaning that styles can be layered and prioritized based on rules of inheritance and specificity, giving developers fine-grained <br/>
            control over the appearance of web content. CSS is an essential part of modern web development because it enhances the user experience by making web pages visually appealing and interactive. It supports <br/>
            responsive design, enabling websites to adapt seamlessly to different devices and screen sizes. Additionally, CSS can be applied inline (within HTML elements), internally (and the style tag), or external (via<br/>
            linked CSS files), with external stylesheets being the most common and scalable appraoch. Advanced features of CSS, such as animations, transitions, and grid or flexbox layouts, allow developers to create <br/>
            dymanic and sophisticated web deisgns without relying heavily on JavaScript. <br/>

        <h2 class="title">JAVASCRIPT (JS)</h2>
        <h4>Is responsible of the functionality of the Website</h4>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarily designed for creating interactive and dynamic web appilcations. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, along side HTML <br/>
            and CSS enabling developrs to build responsive users interfaces and add interactive features such as animtations, from validations, and real-time updates. JavaScript is excecuted in web browsers, allowing it to <br/>
            modify the content and behavior and web pages wothout needing to reload them. This client-side capability has made it indispensable for modern development. Beyond the browsers, JavaScript has <br/>
            expanded its reached with platform like Node js, wo=hich allows developers to write server-side code. This versatality has transformed javascript into a full-stack language capable of handling both front-end and <br/>
            back-end development. Additionally, it supports numerous frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular and Vue js, which streamline the development process and help create features-rich applications. Its <br/>
            ability to work accross platforms and its continuous evolution have made JavaScript one of the most popular programming languages in the world. <br/>
